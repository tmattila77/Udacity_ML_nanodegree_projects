# Udacity_ML_nanodegree_projects
In this repository, I publish my end-of-topic projects I completed whilst following the Udacity Introduction to Machine Learning Nanodegree Program.

I am new in the area of Machine Learning, so decided to follow the mentioned program with Udacity. 
The course covers the 3 main fields of Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised and Deep Learning. 
At the end of each chapter I carried out a project.

For supervised learning project, I created a model that helps an imaginary charity to find potential donors. Using the 1994. U.S. Census data, my model predicts with good accuracy whether or not a person makes more than 50k dollars a year. After exploring and preprocessing the data, I priliminarely chose Decision Tree, SVM and Gaussian Naive Bayse models to test their performance and to choose the right one for the job. Finally, I chose SVM because it wokred with higher accuracy, however, it was a bit slower. At the end of the project I carried out feature selection to reduce time and computational capacity, and investigated how features selection affects beta score and accuracy. You can find my project completed in a Jupyter Notebook.

For deep learning project I worked on an image classifier trained on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset using Tensorflow and Keras. After exloring the data I applied transfer learning and imported MobileNet v2 from Tensorflow Hub. Redesigning the neural network I trained and tested my model and checked its performance. I let my model to carry out inference and tested it how it performs when make predictions using a separate test dataset. My project can be seen not only in a Jupyter Notebook but I designed a Python program that can be run in command line and does the same job that the one in the Jupyter Notebook. 


I would like to publish my projects as my starter ML projects. 
I am going to extend this repository with my own projects after completing the program.
