# Udacity_ML_nanodegree_projects
In this repository, I publish my end-of-topic projects I completed whilst following the Udacity Intro to ML Nanodegree Program.

I am new in the field of Machine Learning, so decided to follow the Introduction to ML Nanodegree Program with Udacity. 
At the end of each topic we carry out a project. I would like to publish my projects as my starter ML projects. 
I am going to extend this repository with my own projects after completing the program.
